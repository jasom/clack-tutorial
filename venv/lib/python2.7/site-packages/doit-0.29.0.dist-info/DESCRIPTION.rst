`doit` is a task management & automation tool

`doit` comes from the idea of bringing the power of build-tools
 to execute any kind of **task**

`doit` is a modern open-source build-tool written in python
designed to be simple to use and flexible to deal with complex work-flows.
It is specially suitable for building and managing custom work-flows where
there is no out-of-the-box solution available.

`doit` has been successfully used on: systems test/integration automation,
scientific computational pipelines, content generation,
configuration management, etc.
